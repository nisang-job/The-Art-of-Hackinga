# Kali in AWS
Kali Linux is already available at Amazon's AWS marketplace at:
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M26MMTT

Important note from Amazon:

  Once your instance is running, connect to it with your SSH private key using the "ec2-user" account. Don't forget to update your Kali instance to get the latest packages and bug fixes. Type as root (or sudo): apt update && apt dist-upgrade.

  If you are performing penetration testing, please refer to the AWS Testing Request for more information. http://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/
